# Coffee-Machine-Simulator
The Coffee Machine Simulator is an interactive Python program that mimics the functionality of a real coffee vending machine. Users can choose from three types of coffee: espresso, latte, and cappuccino. The simulator manages resources like water, milk, and coffee, and processes transactions based on user input for coin insertion.
Features
Menu Options: Users can select from espresso, latte, and cappuccino.
Resource Management: The program checks if there are enough ingredients to make the selected coffee.
Coin Processing: Users insert coins (quarters, dimes, nickels, and pennies) to pay for their coffee.
Transaction Handling: The program verifies if the inserted money is sufficient and provides change if necessary.
Reporting: Users can request a report to see the remaining resources and total profit.
Shutdown Option: The machine can be turned off by the user.
Installation
To run the Coffee Machine Simulator, you need to have Python installed on your system. You can download Python from the official website.
