# Coffee-Machine-Simulator
The Coffee Machine Simulator is an interactive Python program that mimics the functionality of a real coffee vending machine. Users can choose from three types of coffee: espresso, latte, and cappuccino. The simulator manages resources like water, milk, and coffee, and processes transactions based on user input for coin insertion.
